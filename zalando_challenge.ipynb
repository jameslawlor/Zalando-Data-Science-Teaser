    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I found a fun short project recently, set by the online fashion company Zalando to people applying for their Data Science positions. The goal of the project is to locate the whereabouts of a new analyst that they wish to recruit, given some limited information about her. My code below suggests three high probability locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a power plant called Heizkraftwerk Klingenberg at Lat/Lon coordinates (52.4911, 13.4948).\n",
    "2. the Zalando Content Creation office at (52.5094, 13.4367).\n",
    "3. Technische Universtität Berlin's Produktionstechnisches Zentrum at (52.5247, 13.3222).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I’ll go through my implementation, both the python code and the small amount of maths needed. In the course of doing research for the project I found a couple of nice alternative solutions: see the blogs of [Aonghus Lawlor](http://aonghuslawlor.com/blog/zalando-challenge.html) (no relation) and [Yaser Martinez](http://yasermartinez.com/zalando/report.html). I have to admit both of them have produced a much more visually appealing result than my code can manage currently, however we do get similar results for the analyst location. I had a lot of issues with the map tiling needed to generate a result similar to theirs, when I learn more about them I hope to come back to this mini project and fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem itself involves modelling three probability distributions over a Cartesian plane that represents Berlin. By combining these distributions and finding the maxima it’s possible to figure out the most likely location(s). The solution below is laid out as follows:\n",
    "1. For self-containment I’ll first recap the challenge brief as it is set by Zalando.\n",
    "2. Probability Distributions for the three data sources.\n",
    "3. Shortest Euclidean distance from a point to a line segment\n",
    "4. Coordinate Transform. Her coordinates are given in terms of latitude and longitude but they’ve been kind enough to give us a decent coordinate transform that takes us to a Cartesian plane (i.e. flat instead of spherical).\n",
    "5. Python implementation for high probability locations\n",
    "6. Heatmap plot\n",
    "7. Where is the analyst?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 - Challenge Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zalando Data Intelligence Team is searching for a new top analyst. We already know of an excellent candidate with top analytical and programming skills. Unfortunately, we don’t know her exact whereabouts but we only have some vague information where she might be. Can you tell us where to best send our recruiters and plot an easy to read map of your solution for them?  This is what we could extract from independent sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The candidate is likely to be close to the river Spree. The probability at any point is given by a Gaussian function of its shortest distance to the river. The function peaks at zero and has 95\\% of its total integral within +-2730m.\n",
    "* A probability distribution centred around the Brandenburg Gate also informs us of the candidate’s location. The distribution’s radial profile is log-normal with a mean of 4700m and a mode of 3877m in every direction.\n",
    "* A satellite offers further information: with 95% probability she is located within 2400 m distance of the satellite’s path (assuming a normal probability distribution)."

    "A heat map of $P$ is shown in the above figure where we identify three distinct locations with high probabilities using the brute force optimisation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Highest probability ($p=0.207$) at coordinates (52.4911, 13.4948) at Heizkraftwerk Klingenberg, a power plant.\n",
    "* Second highest probability ($p=0.194$) at (52.5094, 13.4367), the Zalando Content Creation office.\n",
    "* Third highest ($p=0.185$) at (52.5247, 13.3222) corresponding to Technische Universtität Berlin: Produktionstechnisches Zentrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition suggests that the third option is the most 'sensible' place to find the analyst although it is not the most probable according to the calculation. The power plant would be a surprising place to find such a skilled analyst and presumably if they were at the Zalando office their whereabouts would be known to the team already (or quickly checked). \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be explained by the fact we initially assumed all three data sources were equally reliable. If we were to have additional information on the accuracy of these sources it would be possible to weight the separate probability distributions accordingly, leading to a different total probability distribution $P$. For example, it can be immediately inferred from the figure that removing the satellite source would make the University and Zalando locations much more probable, as well as effectively removing the power plant as a point of interest.\n",
    " \n",
    "Using the figure again we can also suggest that if the analyst is not at the three locations above, there exists a high probability path (an arête-like feature) between the power plant and the Zalando office along the North bank of the Spree. Potential locations along this path include a large Mercedes-Benz office, several nightclubs and a sports centre.\n"

Zalando are a European online fashion retailer and they set this challenge
to applicants for their Data Science jobs. The goal is to locate the whereabouts
of a new analyst that they wish to recruit, given some limited information about
her.

The solution involves modelling three probability distributions over a Cartesian
plane that represents Berlin. By combining these distributions and finding 
the maxima it's possible to figure out the most likely location(s).
